                    We were tasked with taking care of the Back-End code of the website, the Database it would connect to, the user authentication using LDAP, the webserver it would be hosted with and finally the OS it would be hosted on (user permissions, firewall configuration, etc.).<br><br>
                    The webapplication with all it's required services had to be build in a Virtual Machine, to make the development process easier we elected to use Samba for directory access from host to guest.`,
